Whispers of the Night

Beneath the moon's soft, silvery glow,
A symphony of whispers begins to flow.
Stars above, each one a tale untold,
In the night's embrace, mysteries unfold.

The night breeze weaves through shadowed trees,
Carrying secrets on the wings of a gentle tease.
Owls converse in a language of the wise,
As constellations paint stories in the skies.

Fireflies dance with a rhythmic grace,
Their tiny lanterns light up the space.
Crickets serenade in the velvet night,
A lullaby that brings dreams to flight.

The moon, a guardian in the cosmic sea,
Watches over with serene majesty.
Night's canvas, a masterpiece in obsidian,
Where dreams and stars find their origin.

Embrace the silence, let the night unfold,
As the universe its wonders behold.
In the hush, where shadows softly play,
Listen to the whispers of the night, they say.
