Echoes of Time

In the tapestry of time, a story unfolds,
Echoes of ages, in whispers, it's told.
Ancient stones, witness to the past,
Each moment, a treasure, forever to last.

Mountains stand as silent sentinels,
Guardians of tales, where history dwells.
Rivers weave through landscapes old,
Carving the narrative, a saga to be told.

In the rustle of leaves, secrets reside,
Nature's confessions, nowhere to hide.
The wind carries voices of days gone by,
A lullaby sung under the vast sky.

Stars above, like shimmering dust,
Chronicles written in constellations thrust.
Moonlight paints a silver rhyme,
An ode to the passage of fleeting time.

Footprints in sand, whispers in the breeze,
Legacy etched in the bark of ancient trees.
Sunsets that kiss the horizon's line,
A testimony to moments, divine.

Embrace the echoes of time's embrace,
A journey woven with threads of grace.
In every heartbeat, in every chime,
Resounds the poetry of echoes through time.
