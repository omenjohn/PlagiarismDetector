A Symphony of Seasons

In springtime's tender, blossoming embrace,
Nature awakens with a gentle grace.
Cherry blossoms in the breeze confide,
A whispered promise of beauty worldwide.

Summer arrives with a vibrant song,
Golden rays and days that grow strong.
Fields of green in the warm sunlight,
Nature's canvas painted with pure delight.

Autumn's breath, a crisp and golden kiss,
Leaves descend in a rhythmic bliss.
A tapestry of hues adorns the land,
Nature's masterpiece, meticulously planned.

Winter's hush, a blanket of pristine white,
Silent landscapes in the pale moonlight.
Icy crystals sparkle, a frosty trance,
Nature's quiet ballet, a wintry dance.

Through seasons' rhythm, a timeless rhyme,
Nature's symphony, an enchanting paradigm.
In every whisper of wind and rustling tree,
A song of life, a timeless melody.
