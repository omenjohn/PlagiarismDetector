Whispers of the Evening

In the hush of twilight's tender glow,
When the sun bids its fiery adieu,
A symphony of stars begins to show,
And the moon weaves dreams anew.

Whispers of the evening breeze,
Caress the trees in rhythmic sway,
Nature's lullaby, a gentle tease,
As daylight slowly fades away.

Silhouettes dance on the horizon's edge,
Painting tales with shadows bold,
A celestial theater, a twilight pledge,
In the canvas of the sky, stories unfold.

Moonbeams, like silver threads so fine,
Illuminate the world with a soft gleam,
In the quiet of the night, dreams entwine,
And reality succumbs to a celestial dream.
